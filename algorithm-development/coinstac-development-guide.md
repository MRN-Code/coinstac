[![Coinstac](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac/raw/master/packages/coinstac-ui/img/icons/png/64x64.png)](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac)

Coinstac is a Electron based application environment for decentralized algorithms, this guide aims to describe developing an alogrithm in Coinstac.


### Requirements

  - lastest version of [coinstac-simulator](https://npm.org/packages/coinstac-simulator)
    ```sudo npm i -g coisntac-simulator```
  - latest version of [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

## Getting Started
To successfully run computation in the simulator we need to
- [Create a compsec](#Create-a-compsec)
- [Create a dockerfile](#Create-a-dockerfile)
- [Create a the scripts](#Create-a-the-scripts)
- [Create an inputspec](#Create-an-inputspec)

#### Create a compsec
Starting a Coinstac computatation begins with making a `compspec.json` a document that allows the Coinstac system to understand how to run and use your computation with others or by itself.

Below is an example from the Coinstac regression algorithm. There is a metadata section containing usefull data, and a computation section for how to use your computation.

The key sections here are
- **type** - docker is the only supported method for running computations at the moment
- **dockerImage** - the name of the docker image to run, the image needs to be pulled locally or available on dockerhub
- **command** - the command to call when your docker image is started, this should be an array of args
- **remote** - if your computation has a decentralized component, the remote section is a mirror of the above, but for the remote. The remote can and usually uses the same docker image but calls a different file.
- **input** - what your computation needs to start running a full overview can be found in the [computation spec api doc](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac/tree/master/algorithm-development/computation-specification-api.md). For now lets take a look at an example:
- 
```json      
"lambda": // name of your variable as it will be in your script
      {
        "defaultValue": 0,
        "label": "Lambda", // what the UI will call your variable
        "max": 1,
        "min": 0,
        "step": 0.05, // step by which the UI will increment your variable
        "type": "number", // what type your variable is, more in the comp spec api
        "source": "owner" // optional: only necessary for the UI if the pipeline
                          // creator must supply the value
      },
```

##### Full compspec example

{
  "meta": {
    "name": "single shot regression demo",
    "id": "ssr_fsl",
    "version": "v1.0.0",
    "repository": "https:\/\/github.com\/MRN-Code\/coinstac_ssr_fsl",

    "dockerImage": "coinstac/ssr",
    "command": [
      "python",
      "\/computation\/local.py"
    ],
    "remote": {
      "type": "docker",
      "dockerImage": "coinstac/ssr",
      "command": [

      }
    },
    "output": { // blank for now
    },
    "display": [ // blank for now
    ]
  }
}
```

### Create a Dockerfile
To run your computation in Coinstac you'll need to encapsulate it in a docker image, for now we have one base python 3.6 image that all computations must inherit from. The Docker file use that image as a base, puts your code into `/computation`, and does any install required by your code.

**Note**: please ignore any test or extraneous files using a `.dockerignore`, this keeps image size down
```sh
FROM coinstac/coinstac-base-python-stream
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /computation
# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY requirements.txt /computation
# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /computation
```
### Create the scripts
Here is a simple example that just sends a number and sums it until it reaches `5`

##### local script
#
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
  
import sys
import json

doc = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
if 'start' in doc['input']:
    sums = 1
else:
    sums = doc['input']['sum'] + 1

output = { "output": { "sum": sums } }
sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(output))
```

##### remote script
#
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
  
import sys
import json

doc = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
sums = 0
for site, output in doc['input'].items():
    sums = sums + output['sum'];
sums = sums / len(doc['input'])
if sums > 4:
    success = True
else:
    success = False

output = { "output": { "sum": sums }, "success": success }
sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(output))
```

##### And the compspec this uses
#
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "name": "decentralized test",
    "id": "coinstac-decentralized-test",
    "version": "v1.0.0",
    "repository": "github.com\/user\/computation.git",
    "description": "a test that sums the last two numbers together for the next"
  },
  "computation": {
    "type": "docker",
    "dockerImage": "coinstac\/coinstac-decentralized-test",
    "command": [
      "python",
      "\/computation\/local.py"
    ],
    "remote": {
      "type": "docker",
      "dockerImage": "coinstac\/coinstac-decentralized-test",
      "command": [
        "python",
        "\/computation\/remote.py"
      ]
    },
    "input": {
      "start": {
        "type": "number"
      }
    },
    "output": {
      "sum": {
        "type": "number",
        "label": "Decentralized Sum"
      }
    },
    "display": {
      "type": "table"
    }
  }
}
```
##### Creating an inputspec
To run a computation in `coinstac-simulator` we need a document that gives the pipeline the inital input with relation to the `compspec`. This document is smaller chunk of what the UI generates for the pipeline, the rest is done for you in simulator.

The `inputspec.json`'s default location is in a folder called `./test` in your root directory. The `inputspec` is just the variables in your `compspec`'s `input` section with fulfilled values. Here's and example:

```json
{
"start":  // just the variable name we choose for our sum example
  {
    "value": 1 // the inital value given to the pipeline
  }
}
```

If you specify more clients in the simulator with the `-c` flag, the above data will just be cloned amoung them to start with. To start with different data for each client, make the `inputspec` an array:
```json
[
  {
  "start":  // just the variable name we choose for our sum example
    {
      "value": 1 // the inital value given to the pipeline
    }
  },
  {
  "start":  // just the variable name we choose for our sum example
    {
      "value": 1.5 // the inital value given to the pipeline
    }
  }
]
```
##### Running the computation
We have our compspec, local, and remote scripts, now let's try to run it
First we'll want to build our docker box, on some machines (linux and possibly windows) you may have to run these commands as an **administrator**.
```sh
docker build -t coinstac/coinstac-decentralized-test .
```
**Note**: the image name in the `-t` tag **_must_** be the same as your `dockerImage` in your `compspec`
Now in the **root* directory of your project run:
```sh
coinstac-simulator
```
You should see the computation start
![compstart](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac/raw/master/algorithm-development/compstart.png)
End
![compend](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac/raw/master/algorithm-development/compend.png)
And finally the output as JSON
![compoutput](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac/raw/master/algorithm-development/compoutput.png)

##### local vs decentralized
local and decentralized computations are made nearly the same, except for two key differences: Decentralized computations **_always_** are ended by the remote, and decentralized computations have a `"remote"` section in their compspec.

## Advanced usage
In this secion we'll go over some more advanced use cases of simualtor and Coinstac itself
#### Adding test files in simulator
Adding files to simulator is a bit of a manual process at the moment, they must be put into the `./test` folder under a the automatic sitenames the simualtor generates. Sim names each site `local#` where # is 0 to the number of clients the run has. Here's what the directory sturcture looks like for `local0`, or the first client:

```sh
├── test
│   ├── inputspec.json
│   ├── local0
│   │   └── simulatorRun
│   │       ├── subject0_aseg_stats.txt
│   │       ├── subject10_aseg_stats.txt
```
The `simualtorRun` directory is the directory that is shared into docker, put your files in there and they will be accessible by your computation via `["state"]["baseDirectory"] + myfile.txt` for a python example.
## A full fledged example
A more real world example can be found [here](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac_ssr_fsl) with our Single Shot Regression Demo that uses freesurfer file test data to run it's simulator example
